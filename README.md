## A description of the problem and a discussion of the background.
From a business class that I took in the past, the most important factor of succeeding in the retail industry is it's location. Where ever there is a good traffic of people, the sales sky rockets due to the people entering the store.

In order to test this, I will use Foursquare data search feature to 

From the previous graded assignment, I generated the location data of each of the postcode.

## A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.

I have the location information of each postal code in Toronto from the previous assigment. I can use this to assemble the number of the retail stores that shows up on the Foursquare search. 

This will generate information of the number of the retail stores aound that specific location. 

There are traffic data that is available for "TTC Ridership â€“ Subway/Scarborough RT Station Usage"
